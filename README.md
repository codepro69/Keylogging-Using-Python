# Python Keylogger 🖥️

A lightweight Python-based keylogger that captures and records keyboard inputs. This project demonstrates how to use Python's `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events and log them into a text file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures and logs all keystrokes, including alphanumeric and special keys.
- **Special Key Support**: Handles and logs keys like `Space`, `Enter`, and `Backspace` in a readable format.
- **File-Based Logging**: Saves all logged keystrokes into a text file (`keylog.txt`) for analysis.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and straightforward to use.

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-keylogger.git
   cd python-keylogger


⚙️ How It Works
The script listens for all keyboard events using the pynput library.
Each keystroke is logged and written to a file named keylog.txt.
Special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Backspace) are logged with descriptive names to maintain readability.
📝 Usage Examples
Educational: Learn how to implement keylogging and understand event-listening in Python.
System Monitoring: Monitor keyboard activity for personal systems (with explicit consent).
📖 Legal Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keylogging tools is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have explicit consent before using this software on any system. Misuse of this project may result in severe legal consequences. Use responsibly.
